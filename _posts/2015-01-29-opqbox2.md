We are super psyched to announce that a second design for our second generation OPQBox hardware device is now available for review at the [OPQBox2 Repo Home Page](http://openpowerquality.github.io/opqbox2).

This version of the design incorporates [lots of fixes](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opqbox2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) found during the "initial" design's review.

Please take a look and let us know what you think.  We hope to make engineering samples during February, 2015.
