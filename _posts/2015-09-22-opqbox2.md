We are super, duper psyched to announce that a **third** design for our second generation OPQBox hardware device is now available for review at the [OPQBox2 Repo Home Page](http://openpowerquality.github.io/opqbox2).

We are making engineering samples of this design, although we are also continuing to make design changes and improvements.  Here's a [list of issues we're working on](https://github.com/openpowerquality/opqbox2/labels/G2%20Design%202).

Please take a look and let us know what you think.
