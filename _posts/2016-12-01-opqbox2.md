Just in time for the holidays!  We have assembled a small batch of OPQBoxes with our latest design, and they are now collecting and sending data to our new software infrastructure.  We are excited about this design as it should provide higher accuracy data that is more amenable to analysis than our previous generation. 

We will have another announcement soon when our documentation is brought up to date.
