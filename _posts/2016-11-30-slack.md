As some of you might have noticed, our [OPQ Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openpowerquality) has been dormant for quite a while.

It's not because we haven't been working or communicating, it's because we've moved over to Slack for our internal communications.  We've recently decided to open up our Slack Team for outside collaborators to help us improve communication. 

So, if you're interested in the OPQ Project and want to learn more about our ongoing progress, please email Philip Johnson (johnson@hawaii.edu) to request an invitation to the [OPQ Slack Team](https://openpowerquality.slack.com/).
