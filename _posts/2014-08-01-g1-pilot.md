The OPQ team is delighted to announce the start of a pilot study to evaluate our [Generation 1 (Pipeline)](/technology/roadmap.html#G1:Pipeline) technology.

The pilot study will involve deployment of 5 OPQBoxes to various locations around Oahu, with the data sent to our [public OPQHub](http://emilia.ics.hawaii.edu:8194/).  

The goal of the study is to improve the usability of our software interface, discover bugs, and (with any luck) collect some interesting power quality events.
