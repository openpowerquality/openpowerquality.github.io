It's been too long since we published an OPQ news item!  We're working hard on rolling out a vastly improved version of OPQ:

* OPQ now supports a suite of cloud-based services called Mauka, Makai, and View.  This increases the flexibility and scalability of OPQ.

* We are actively investigating manufacturing services. No more in-house soldering!  This will enable us to easily scale up the production of OPQBoxes and decrease the price. 

* If all goes according to plan, we will be making OPQ technology widely available by 2018. Stay tuned!
