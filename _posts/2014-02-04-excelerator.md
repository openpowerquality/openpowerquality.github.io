Last week Justin Carland and Philip Johnson participated in the [Energy Excelerator](http://www.energyexcelerator.com/)'s 2014 Seed Week program.  Representatives from nine energy-related startups attended an 8 day immersive experience at the Energy Excelerator offices in downtown Honolulu. This week kicked off a year-long process of mentorship to help the startups become viable businesses that create a more positive energy future in Hawaii and across the world.
