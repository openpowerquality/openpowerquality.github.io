The OPQ team has published a technical report proposing a three year project to investigate the use of open power quality.
 
Abstract: This technical report presents a research project designed to gain insight into the following questions: Can crowdsourced power quality data enable active participation in the Smart Grid? What are the technical, social, behavioral, and economic requirements for crowdsourced data that make it effective for detection, monitoring, prediction and diagnosis of selected Smart Grid power quality issues? And finally, how can these project outcomes improve “citizen science” in general and the kinds of intrinsic and extrinsic motivators needed for successful outcomes?
