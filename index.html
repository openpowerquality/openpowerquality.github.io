        <h3><strong>Designed for utilities, campuses, renewable energy providers, power specialists, consumers, and anyone else who wants increased use of renewable energy sources.</strong></h3>

        <p>
          Our target users include macro-grid providers (electrical utilities), micro-grid providers (military, academia, and large corporations), renewable energy providers, power quality specialists, and even everyday consumers interested in their power quality.</p>
        <p>See the <a href="/organization/community.html">community</a> page for more details on these user groups.</p>
        <p><strong>Our ultimate goal is to help society move from reliance on fossil fuels to more efficient, robust, and renewable energy sources.</strong></p>

        <h3><strong>OPQBox: Low cost, open source hardware</strong></h3>

        <p>Our OPQBox costs less than US$100 to manufacture, and the schematics are published under an open source hardware license if you want to build it yourself.
        </p>

        <p>We want to create and support an ecosystem of hardware developers that accelerate the development of new designs to satisfy different needs.

        <h3><strong>OPQ Cloud: A suite of cloud-based, open source software services</strong></h3>

        <p>Each OPQBox sends power quality events and data to our collection of cloud-based services: OPQ Mauka, OPQ Makai, and OPQ View.</p>
        <p>OPQ cloud services can be installed and run locally, or deployed to a hosting environment. We also host an instance ourselves.</p>
        <p>For consumers, this means that you can easily determine if a power quality problem is local to your own house or is more widespread in your neighborhood or city by accessing our hosted cloud services.</p>
        <p>For organizations, this means you can deploy OPQBoxes throughout your facility, and install OPQ Cloud yourself if you want to keep your power quality information private.</p>

        <h3><strong>OPQ View: Open source analytics for the smart grid</strong></h3>

        <p>
         Uploading the raw data is only the start. The real power of the OPQ ecosystem is the kinds of analytics it makes possible.
        </p>
        <p>First, each OPQBox is associated with an owner-supplied location, such as a zipcode. This enables OPQ View to provide geographic views of power quality data, which can be superimposed with substation information from the utility provider. </p>
        <p>Second, the community nature of OPQ data makes it trivial to determine if a power quality event is local to you or more widespread on the grid.</p>
        <p>Third, correlation of power quality data with other forms of information can provide valuable insight into the impact of renewable energy.  For example, are power quality events more common in areas with high concentration of rooftop solar?  Do power quality events correlate with weather data---for example, a rapidly moving cloud cover?</p>
        <p>The OPQ architecture is designed to support "plugin" analytics. Have an idea for a new analytic? Let us know!</p>
